Monopoly has ended friendships and split up families since 1935.
Lets simulate in a safe environment some of the blood thristy property tycoon activities
Lets make a game that simulates a single player visiting land at random.
A player starts with £1500 and moves around the board randomly (2 rolled dice)
Some of this land is owned by someone else, lets call them "The One Percent" if a player lands on one of these properties then their balance is reduced by £100
If a player makes it round the board then their balance is increased by £200
If a player's balance hits zero they lose the game.
The land on a board appears in the following order (i've included the price and colour group but we may not have time to use that information)
